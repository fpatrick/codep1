# In naturE

in nature = be in nature.

Ix xxxxxE = IE (Ireland)

Like myself, many are connected all the time, living a digital life, being sedentary. But what if everyone knew how easy and accessible is he nature, the trails. How good it feels, how much their health can improve. So thats the website, a gallery of easy places to go made by a senderary digital person.

In naturE is a direct to the point with a minimal information of places like in a restaurant menu. It is a "hybrid" blogstyle website with a overview of places I visited and can reccomend or not, primarily for sedentary or starters.

The colors follow a rust color pallet https://colors.dopely.top/palettes/o4cMvI0G7sX that remind of nature, vegetation, forest.
